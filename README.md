# Hackathon 2019

SB Cotton's <strong>2019 Spring Hackathon</strong> was dedicated to allow participants create an interesting, multi-faced web app. The 3-day Hackathon provided participants a platform to explore and play with modern and emerging technologies. 

The 9 participants were divided into two groups. One group of 4 worked on the front-end and the other group of 5 backed the back-end. 


### Front-end Group

4 members of the front-end group, were each assigned a different task which was later merged to create a web app.


- Maps: A user-interactive map was initilaized using Mapbox GL JS. HTML elements were used to embed the map in the web app. Data points on the map were visualized using Loation Markers.  


- Charts: 5 different types of chart each displaying the test scores of students was added to the web app using Chart.Js. The types of charts displayed are: Line, Horizontal Bar, Doughnut, Pie, and Polar. The chart designs were modified using CSS.
