# Hackathon 2019

SB Cotton's <strong>2019 Spring Hackathon</strong> was dedicated to allow participants create an interesting, multi-faced web app. The 3-day Hackathon provided participants a platform to explore and play with modern and emerging technologies. 

The 8 participants were divided into two groups of 4. One group worked on the front-end and the other group backed the back-end.
